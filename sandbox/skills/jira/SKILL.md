# Jira Cloud in this sandbox

Credentials are pre-injected. Do NOT attempt interactive login, OAuth flows,
or ask the user for a token.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | API token. Its value looks like an opaque `openshell:resolve:env:*` placeholder — this is expected. Use it exactly as if it were the real token; the sandbox proxy substitutes the real value at egress. Never try to decode, print, or work around it. |
| `JIRA_EMAIL` | Account email. Used ONLY for classic-token Basic auth. May be unset. |
| `JIRA_BASE_URL` | Site base URL. May be unset — if so, derive it (see below). |

**`JIRA_EMAIL` and `JIRA_BASE_URL` may be missing.** Do not fail if they are
unset — this skill derives everything it needs from `JIRA_API_TOKEN` plus the
tenant's cloudId. Never guess an email address; only use `JIRA_EMAIL` if it is
actually set.

## There are two Jira token types — you MUST pick the right one

Atlassian has two kinds of API token, and each requires a DIFFERENT host and
auth header. Using the wrong combination fails with 401/403 even though the
token is valid.

| Token type | Correct host | Auth header | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scoped** (has scopes like `read:jira-work`) | `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>` | `Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Fails on `*.atlassian.net`. Does NOT use email. |
| **Classic** (no scopes) | `https://<site>.atlassian.net` | Basic: `-u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN"` | Fails on `api.atlassian.com`. Requires `JIRA_EMAIL`. |

You cannot read the token to tell which type it is. **Detect it empirically**
by probing `/rest/api/3/myself` with each mode and using whichever returns
HTTP 200. Run the setup block below ONCE at the start of any Jira work, then
reuse `$JB` (base URL) and the `jira` shell function for every call.

## Setup: detect auth mode (run this first, every session)

```shell
# 1. Determine the tenant cloudId and the scoped base URL.
#    Fast path: if JIRA_BASE_URL is already the scoped
#    api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId> form (the recommended provider
#    config), use it directly and make NO discovery call.
CID=""; SCOPED_BASE=""
case "${JIRA_BASE_URL:-}" in
  https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/*)
    SCOPED_BASE="${JIRA_BASE_URL%/}"
    CID="${SCOPED_BASE##*/ex/jira/}"; CID="${CID%%/*}"
    ;;
esac

# Site host for classic-token Basic auth (and discovery fallback only).
_site="${JIRA_BASE_URL:-https://redhat.atlassian.net}"
case "$_site" in
  https://api.atlassian.com*) _site="https://redhat.atlassian.net" ;;
esac

# Fallback: derive cloudId from the tenant_info discovery endpoint ONLY when it
# was not supplied via JIRA_BASE_URL. This endpoint may be denied by the
# provider egress policy; if it is, set JIRA_BASE_URL to the scoped form
# (api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>) on the provider instead of relying on
# discovery.
if [ -z "$CID" ]; then
  CID="$(curl -sS "$_site/_edge/tenant_info" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["cloudId"])' 2>/dev/null || true)"
fi
[ -z "$SCOPED_BASE" ] && [ -n "$CID" ] && SCOPED_BASE="https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/$CID"

# 2. Probe scoped (Bearer @ api.atlassian.com) first, then classic (Basic @ site).
JB=""; JAUTH=""
if [ -n "$SCOPED_BASE" ] && [ "$(curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
      "$SCOPED_BASE/rest/api/3/myself")" = "200" ]; then
  JB="$SCOPED_BASE"
  JAUTH="bearer"
elif [ -n "$JIRA_EMAIL" ] && [ "$(curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' \
      -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
      "$_site/rest/api/3/myself")" = "200" ]; then
  JB="$_site"
  JAUTH="basic"
else
  echo "ERROR: Jira auth failed for both scoped (Bearer) and classic (Basic) modes." >&2
  echo "Scoped needs api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>; classic needs JIRA_EMAIL set." >&2
  echo "If cloudId discovery (_edge/tenant_info) is policy-denied, set JIRA_BASE_URL" >&2
  echo "to the scoped api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId> form on the provider." >&2
  return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1
fi
echo "Jira auth mode: $JAUTH  base: $JB"

# 3. Define a helper that applies the detected auth to every request.
jira() {  # usage: jira <curl-args...> <path-relative-to-JB>
  if [ "$JAUTH" = "bearer" ]; then
    curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$@"
  else
    curl -sS -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$@"
  fi
}
```

After this runs, `$JB` is the correct base URL and `jira ...` carries the
correct auth. Build every API URL as `"$JB/rest/api/3/..."`.

## How to call the API

Always go through the `jira` helper and `$JB` from the setup block:

```shell
jira -H "Accept: application/json" "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123"
```

## What is allowed (proxy-enforced)

Reads: any `GET` under `/rest/api/3/**` and `/rest/agile/1.0/**` — this
covers getting an issue, comments, transitions list, editmeta, createmeta,
field IDs, project lookups, and `/myself` (the agent's own account) — plus
`POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` for JQL search, plus
`GET /_edge/tenant_info` for cloudId discovery (used by the setup block).

Writes — these specific operations are permitted. Nothing else is: no
deletes, no bulk operations, no attachments, no worklogs, no
watchers/votes, no issue-to-issue links, and no admin endpoints
(workflow/permission schemes, etc.).

1. Create an issue:

```shell
jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/issue" \
  -d '{"fields":{"project":{"key":"PROJ"},"issuetype":{"name":"Bug"},"summary":"Short summary here","description":{"type":"doc","version":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Description text here"}]}]}}}'
```

1. Edit an issue's fields. Always `GET .../editmeta` first to see which
   fields are editable on this issue and how (field IDs vary per
   project/issue type — never guess a `customfield_NNNNN` ID), then `PUT`
   with only the fields you're changing:

```shell
jira "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/editmeta"

jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PUT "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123" \
  -d '{"fields":{"summary":"Updated summary"}}'
```

1. Create a comment:

```shell
jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/comment" \
  -d '{"body":{"type":"doc","version":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Comment text here"}]}]}}'
```

Comment bodies use Atlassian Document Format (ADF), not plain strings.

1. Create a remote (web) link on an issue:

```shell
jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/remotelink" \
  -d '{"object":{"url":"https://example.com/page","title":"Link title"}}'
```

**Relating two Jira issues — there is no native issue-link write.** Native
issue-to-issue links (`POST /rest/api/3/issueLink`, the "relates to" /
"blocks" / "duplicates" relationships shown in the "Linked issues" panel)
are NOT permitted — see "What is NOT allowed" below. To cross-reference two
related issues, add a reciprocal pair of remote links instead, one on each
issue pointing at the other's Jira URL:

```shell
jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/remotelink" \
  -d '{"object":{"url":"https://<site>.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-456","title":"Related: PROJ-456 (short description)"}}'

jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-456/remotelink" \
  -d '{"object":{"url":"https://<site>.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123","title":"Related: PROJ-123 (short description)"}}'
```

This is a weaker substitute — it doesn't carry link-type semantics and
won't appear in the "Linked issues" panel, only as a remote link entry — but
it's the only cross-issue-reference mechanism this policy grants. See
ROSAENG-70715.

1. Transition an issue. Transition IDs are per-project/per-workflow and not
   guessable, so always `GET .../transitions` first to find the numeric ID
   for the target status, then `POST` it:

```shell
jira "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/transitions"

jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/transitions" \
  -d '{"transition":{"id":"<id from the GET above>"}}'
```

1. Self-assign an issue. Get the agent's own `accountId` from `/myself`
   first, then `PUT` it as the assignee (this endpoint only accepts
   self-assignment in this policy — assigning to a different account is not
   permitted):

```shell
jira "$JB/rest/api/3/myself"

jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PUT "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/assignee" \
  -d '{"accountId":"<the agent'"'"'s own accountId from /myself>"}'
```

## Useful read patterns

```shell
# JQL search (POST; fields param trims the response)
jira -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "$JB/rest/api/3/search/jql" \
  -d '{"jql":"project = PROJ AND status = \"In Progress\" ORDER BY updated DESC","fields":["summary","status","assignee"],"maxResults":25}'

# Get a single issue
jira "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123"

# Comments on an issue
jira "$JB/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-123/comment"

# Boards (Agile API)
jira "$JB/rest/agile/1.0/board"

# Sprints for a board
jira "$JB/rest/agile/1.0/board/{boardId}/sprint?state=active"
```

## What is NOT allowed

Deleting issues or comments, bulk operations, attachments, worklogs,
watchers/votes, issue-to-issue links (use a pair of reciprocal remote links
instead — see the write pattern above), assigning an issue to someone other
than the agent itself, and admin endpoints (workflow schemes, permission
schemes, etc.) are denied by the sandbox network policy. A denied request
returns HTTP 403 (`policy_denied` or `credential_endpoint_mismatch`). If the
user's task truly requires a blocked operation, follow
`/etc/openshell/skills/policy_advisor.md` to propose the narrowest policy
addition and wait for approval — do not retry variations or attempt to
bypass the proxy.

## Troubleshooting auth (do NOT brute-force emails or tokens)

- **401 on `*.atlassian.net` with Basic** and you have a scoped token → wrong
  host/auth. Use Bearer against `api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>`. The
  setup block already handles this; re-run it.
- **403 on `api.atlassian.com` with Bearer** → the token is classic, not
  scoped. Use Basic against the `*.atlassian.net` site with `JIRA_EMAIL`.
- **Both modes fail** → the credential or `JIRA_EMAIL` is misconfigured on the
  provider. Report the exact HTTP codes and stop; do not guess emails or
  attempt to read/decode the token.
